Currently finding my way through python.

Note this code is a revisitation of a sizable project in my first year com-sci class.  Wasn't able to finish it with my teammate and didn't understand how to code yet.(Project Linked in a folder )

This is my first try after a year ðŸ˜ƒ , and with a more dedicated mindset to go beyond the basics  .  

My Thought Process for this Code.
    The computer (which plays with the black stones) always moves first. After the first move, the userâ€™s and the computerâ€™s moves alternate. The computer determines its move by finding the move that maximises the return value of the score function (which is provided by the Professor of the Course;haven't matured yet to fully code a decent AI based on mathematics and not If/Else statements  ).

Functions in the code accepts board as one of its arguments.The square (y,x) on the board is stored in board[y][x]. The value of the square is:
â€¢ " ", if the square is empty,
â€¢ "b", if the square has a black stone on it, and
â€¢ "w", if the square has a white stone on it.

Functions Written by the Professor:-
	â€¢ print_board(board)
      This function prints out the Gomoku board
	â€¢ score(board)
      This function computes and returns the score for the position of the board. It assumes that black
      has just moved
  â€¢ play_gomoku(board_size)
      This function allows the user to play against a computer on a board of size board size Ã— board size.
  â€¢put_seq_on_board(board, y, x, d_y, d_x, length, col)
      This helper function adds the sequence of stones of colour col of length length to board , starting
      at location (y,x) and moving in the direction (d_y, d_x). This function facilitates the testing of
      the AI engine.

  â€¢analysis(board):
      This function analyses the position of the board by computing the number of open and semi-open
      sequences of both colours
  
Functions Written by Me:-
â€¢    is_empty(board)
â€¢    is_bounded(board, y_end, x_end, length, d_y, d_x)
â€¢    detect row(board, col, y start, x start, length, d y, d x)
â€¢    detect rows(board, col, length)
â€¢    search max(board)
â€¢    is win(board)

Hopefully , I plan tto expand the project and make a decent visual UI for the project 
Something like this:-
